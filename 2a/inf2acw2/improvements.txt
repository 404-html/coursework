The first problem is that the program takes a long time to start, because it need to search brown corpus and sentences.txt to find all the 3s form words and unchanging plurals. This could be improved by using an array of word instead of computing it every time it starts, but this could also make the code looks bulky.
The second problem is that in both stem functions, there are several exceptions from these rules, and the brown corpus and sentences.txt cannot cover all of these exceptions, using more corpus could deal with the problem, but it may also make the program even slower.
The third problem I found is that the rules used in this program only accepts questions that start with "Who/Which" and end with question mark, other methods of asking questions are not covered. This could be hard to implement since it greatly increases the size of the rules.
Another problem is that sometimes a proper name could consist of multiple words (full name of a person), and this won't be accepted by the program, implementing it would be hard because it need to reconstruct the whole program.
The program only accepts correct grammar, for non-native English speaker like me, grammar problems could cause the program fail to parse the sentences I use.
